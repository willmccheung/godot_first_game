# godot First Game

# Overview
This will be my first attempt at making a game using Godot.
I have previously done the Godot tutorials for creating your first games in Godot, which really means this'll be my second (or third?) game I guess.
eh anyway.

This will be my first attempt at making **my own** game using Godot.

This will mainly be for learning more about how to use the game engine, and how to build games
