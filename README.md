# godot First Game

# Overview
This will be my first attempt at making a game using Godot.
I have previously done the Godot tutorials for creating your first games in Godot, which really means this'll be my second (or third?) game I guess.
eh anyway.

This will be my first attempt at making **my own** game using Godot.

This will mainly be for learning more about how to use the game engine, and how to build games, etc.


# Goals
- Learn more about how to develop games
- Learn the Godot game engine

# The Game
## Game Ideas
- probably want to make a 3d game as:
  - it's relatively easy to implement a 3d environment in Godot
  - I'm not smart enough to think of a 2d game with interesting mechanics
  - other stuff as well
-  will want to do something that I can build upon; start small and expand
  - BUT **not** feature-creepy
